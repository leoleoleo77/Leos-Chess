# Leo's Chess

This is an experimental chess project which I created in my free time.

It uses Javascript, HTML and some basic CSS.

You can either play against another human, or againts my super intelligent AI (still in beta).

Any comments or contributions are welcome.

You can try it <a href="https://leoleoleo77.github.io/">here</a>.
